# Students-performance
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the performance of students based on various demographic and socio-economic factors. The dataset contains information on students' gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and their scores in math, reading, and writing.

## Insights

### Distribution of Scores
The distribution of scores provides an overview of the performance of students in math, reading, and writing. It allows us to understand the spread and central tendency of the scores in each subject.

### Gender Comparison of Scores
Comparing the scores based on gender helps us understand if there are any disparities in performance between male and female students. This insight can shed light on potential gender-based differences in academic achievement.

### Ethnicity Comparison of Scores
Analyzing the scores based on ethnicity allows us to identify any variations in performance among different racial or ethnic groups. This insight is crucial for understanding disparities and addressing potential inequalities in education.

### Parental Education Level and Scores
Examining the relationship between parental education level and student scores can provide insights into the impact of parental background on academic achievement. This analysis can help in understanding the role of parental involvement and support in students' performance.

### Lunch Type and Scores
Investigating the relationship between lunch type and scores can reveal if there are any differences in performance based on the socio-economic status of students. This insight can highlight the influence of nutrition and access to resources on academic outcomes.

### Test Preparation Course and Scores
Exploring the impact of test preparation courses on scores can help in assessing the effectiveness of such programs in improving students' performance. This insight is valuable for understanding the benefits of additional academic support.

### Correlation Heatmap
The correlation heatmap provides a visual representation of the relationships between different variables, particularly the correlation between scores in math, reading, and writing. This insight can help in identifying patterns and associations within the dataset.

### Statistical Summary by Gender
A statistical summary by gender allows for a detailed comparison of key metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for each score. This insight facilitates a comprehensive understanding of performance differences between male and female students.

### Statistical Comparison of Math Scores
Statistical comparison of math scores across different demographic groups can reveal any significant variations in performance. This analysis is essential for identifying potential disparities and informing targeted interventions.

### Statistical Comparison of Writing Scores by Ethnicity
Statistical comparison of writing scores by ethnicity provides a detailed examination of performance differences among racial or ethnic groups. This insight is crucial for understanding academic achievement patterns within specific demographic categories.

## Conclusion
By conducting this EDA project, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing students' academic performance. The findings from this analysis can inform educational policies, interventions, and support programs aimed at promoting equitable opportunities and improving student outcomes.
